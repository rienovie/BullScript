; This is outdated, new.basm is the current version





; Basm get's translated directly into ASM (Nasm)
; BullScript will be written ontop of Basm
; BullScript syntax will be less picky than Basm is because more care should be used when writing it
; The theory I have between the two is:
; BullScript - you should be able to stumble into working code
; Basm - you need to know what you're doing to have working code

; But Basm (I think) will be more universal and easier to read than other ASM

; Some basics
; <- used for comments

; values are decimal assumed
; 10		valid decimal value
; 10.0		not valid syntax

; binary 0b prefix
; must be lower case b because I think it's more readable
; 0b1001	valid binary value
; 0B1001	not valid syntax

; hex 0x prefix
; must be lower case x because I think it's more readable
; letters in value (a-f) are NOT case sensitive
; 0x2c		valid hex value
; 0x2C		valid hex value
; 0X2c		not valid syntax

; float e{x} suffix
; must be lower case e because I think it's more readable (again)
; 10.0e0	valid float value
; 10e0		valid float value
; 10E0		not valid syntax
; 10e		not valid syntax
; 10.0		not valid syntax (will probably be valid in BullScript but not here)

; variables are assumed to vary in value unless specfied otherwise
; This assumption will carry to BullScript
; Bullscript will have an enforce option that requires "mutable" for non-const variables but this will not be the default

; when value set will go into .data (Nasm)
; when value not set will go into .bss (Nasm)
; const variables will go into .rodata (Nasm)
; you must specify the size to allocate with uninitialized variables in the attributes

; attributes are the cornerstone of the language that will carry to BullScript
; the ":" will be used at declaration of type/function before the definition/value
; KEYWORD NAME : ATTRIBUTES = VALUE
; KEYWORD NAME : ATTRIBUTES {DEFINITION}

; example of simple variable creation
create message : const, 8b = "Hello World!\n"
; create VarName : readOnly, db = VALUE

; the variable declaration above has a space after message and before const
; the compiler spilts lines by spaces so there must be space between items
; the only exception is the comma which can be handled as part of another item

; Instead of using db, dw, etc uses:
; 8b (db) / 16b (dw) / 32b (dd) / 64b (dq)
; variables require this in the attributes

; can also do a block create
; this is the same as if create was put infront of each
create {
	anotherMessage : 8b = "Hello again!\n"
	aValue : 8b = 8
	unintializedVariable : 16b, 16
	immutableMessage : 8b, const = "Immute Hello!", 10, 0
}

; when using "{}" in basm you must have the open on the first line
; and you must have the close on a line by itself

; define is used to make a new container (wrapper)
define aCoolThing {
	move tempInput, input
	stackPush
	move input, tempInput
	contents
	move tempOutput, output
	stackPop
	move output, tempOutput
	return
}

; in the above container tempInput, input, tempOutput, and output are all registers
; "contents" is the keyword that the container surrounds therefore all containers must have "contents"
; stackPush and stackPop are defined below
; Basm does not require functions to be named in order
; The compiler does a first pass that gets the name of each function and only attempts to translate functions when they are used

; fn is used to define generic functions
fn stackPush {
	pop reg1

	; "multi" is a unique built-in container
	; Starting the line with "multi" means it'll apply the instruction to each line of the container's contents
	; Below this is equivallent to:
	; push regA
	; push regB
	; push regC
	; ...
	multi push {
		regA
		regB
		regC
		regD
		arg1
		arg2
		input
		output
	}

	push reg1

	return
}

; "required" attribute makes the compiler include the fn/var reguardless if it's used or not
fn stackPop : required {
	pop reg1

	; Called in reverse order to maintain correct values from stack
	multi pop {
		output
		input
		arg2
		arg1
		regD
		regC
		regB
		regA
	}

	push reg1

	return
}

; All functions/containers must return but inlines cannot return
; "inline" means it will basically be copy-paste at the location it is called

define if : inline, condition {
	condition
	jumpFalse ifEnd
	contents
	label ifEnd
}

; when "condition" is used as an attribute the define or fn requires a conditional statement input when called
; when "condition" is called it evaluates the conditional statement

; "jumpFalse" takes last condition eval and jumps if false
; "jumpTrue" works as expected
; think of these as "jump if false to" and "jump if true to"
; a condition statement must be surrounded with parenthesis
; example of conditional statement is below
; "&&" "||" with multiple comparisions will probably only be in BullScript not basm
; TODO: look into if multiconditionals would work in basm
; comparsions are:
;   == , != , < , > , <= , >=

define while : inline, condition {
	label whileJump
	if condition {
		contents
		jump whileJump
	}
}

aCoolThing wordLength {
	move output, input
	while (byte [output] != 0) {
		increment output
	}
	subtract output, input
	
	return
}

; when translated to nasm name should be:
; fn_aCoolThing_print
aCoolThing print {
	; three ways to call a syscall / each of these are equivallent
	; as this function is typed, this'll be printed three times
	; $ is used to convert to value of syscall
	; # is used to convert to predetermined values

	; call style one:
	syscall $write, #stdout, input, wordLength input

	; will print newline
	syscall $write, #stdout, "\n", 1

	; call style two:
	move sys, $write
	move arg1, #stdout
	move arg2, input
	move arg3, wordLength input
	
	call ; "call" by itself is assumed "syscall"

	syscall $write, #stdout, "\n", 1

	; call style three:
	multi move {
		sys, $write
		arg1, #stdout
		arg2, input
		arg3, wordLength input
	}
	call

	return
}

fn crash {
	print input
	syscall $exit, 1
}

; It'll be standard practice to use a "entry" & "exit" at the bottom of a file like this
; Both functions will be required
; These are the only two functions that don't have returns
fn exit {
	syscall $exit, 0
}

; the same as the _start function
fn entry {
	print "Hello\n"
	print "hi"
	multi print {
		message
		anotherMessage
		aValue
		"A string literal"
		"A complex string literal\n"
	}
	print "Single line print\n"
	exit; exit will be called even if excluded at the end of the entry function
}
