This is me having fun trying to make a programming language while also improving my c++ skills as well as learning assembly.

If you're interested you can look thru the "Theory" directory to get an idea of what I'm trying to make the language look/feel like.

No idea if it'll actually be good to work with, but I think making this will be fun fun fun :)
