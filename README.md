This is me having fun trying to make a programming language while also improving my c++ skills as well as learning assembly.

If you're interested if you look at the BullScriptBS.txt and the example.bsx it'll give you an idea about what I'm trying to make the language look/feel like.

No idea if it'll actually be good to work with, but I think making this will be fun fun fun :)
